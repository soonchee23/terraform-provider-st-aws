# st-aws_iam_permission_set_attachment (Resource)

Provides an IAM Policy resource that manages policy content exceeding character limits by splitting it into smaller segments. These segments are combined to form a complete policy and attached to the chosen target. Policies like `ReadOnlyAccess` that exceed the maximum length are attached directly.

~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `st-aws_iam_policy_v2` resource when the `permission_set`, `user`, or `role` parameters are set in `st-aws_iam_policy_v2` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "st-aws_iam_permission_set_attachment" "aws_single_sign_on" {
  permission_set_name = "test"
  instance_arn        = "ssoins-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  permission_set_arn  = "arn:aws:sso:::permissionSet/ssoins-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/ps-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  policy_path         = "/"
  attached_policies = [
    "IAMFullAccess",
    "PowerUserAccess",
    "AWSSupportAccess",
  ]
}
```
